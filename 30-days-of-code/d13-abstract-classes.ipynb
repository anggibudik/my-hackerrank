    "### Objective\n",
    "Today, we will extend what we learned yesterday about Inheritance to Abstract Classes. Because this is a very specific object oriented concept, submissions are limited to the few languages that use this construct. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inherits from Book\n",
    "- Has a parameterized constructor taking these $3$ parameters:\n",
    "    1. string $title$\n",
    "    2. string $author$\n",
    "    3. int $price$\n",
    "- Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these $3$ lines:\n",
    "    1. **Title:**, a space, and then the current instance's $title$.\n",
    "    2. **Author:**, a space, and then the current instance's $author$.\n",
    "    3. **Price:**, a space, and then the current instance's $price$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Note**: Because these classes are being written in the same file, you must not use an access modifier (e.g.: **public**) when declaring MyBook or your code will not execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The Solution class creates a Book object and calls the MyBook class constructor (passing it the necessary arguments). It then calls the display method on the Book object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The $void display()$ method should print and label the respective $title$, $author$, and $price$ of the MyBook object's instance (with each value on its own line) like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Title: $title\n",
    "Author: $author\n",
    "Price: $price\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: The \\\\$ is prepended to variable names to indicate they are placeholders for variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The following input from stdin is handled by the locked stub code in your editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Alchemist\n",
    "Paulo Coelho\n",
    "248\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The following output is printed by your display() method:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Title: The Alchemist\n",
    "Author: Paulo Coelho\n",
    "Price: 248\n",
