    "An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of his/her hikes. During the last hike that took exactly ***steps*** steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill (***U***) or a downhill (***D***) step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a ***1*** unit change in altitude.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We define the following terms:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.\n",
    "- A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.\n",

    "Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, **find and print the number of valleys walked through**.\n",

    "$ steps = 8 \\, path = [DDUUUUDD] $\n",

    "The hiker first enters a valley **2** units deep. Then they climb out and up onto a mountain **2** units high. Finally, the hiker returns to sea level and ends the hike.\n",
